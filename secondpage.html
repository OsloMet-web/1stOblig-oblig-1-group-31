<h3>- Navn: Julia, stud.nr: 386116.</h3>
<p><q><i>I graduated from Sandvika vgs in 2021. It is one of the largest schools in Bærum.
     It has around 1000 students. The school has 5 floors. The roof is fully glass so in the 
     summer it feels sooo warm. Its like a greenhouse effect. The cafeteria is super good. It has its 
     own chef who cooks warm meals every day. the meals are in big portions.</i></q></p>
     
<h3>- Navn: David, stud nr:385504 .</h3>
<p><q><i>The last VGS I went to had a super nice lounge area with air hockey and table tennis.
Me and my classmates used this room during the downtime between classes.
There were also a few really talented teachers primarily my homeroom and history teachers.</i></q></p>
    
<h3>- Navn: Hannah, stud.nr: 386103.</h3>
<p><q><i>I graduated from Lake Fenton High School in 2014.
The cafeteria food was really good for being as unexpensive as it was.
A full meal costed 35 NOK, it included an entree, 1 or 2 sides and a drink.
<br>An example of the hot meals was baked turkey and gravy as the entree, mashed potatoes and green beans as a side, and your choice of one of their milk or juice options.</i></q></p>

<h3>- Navn: Sara, stud. nr: 352530.</h3>
<p><q><i>In my VGS we had free fruit in the breaks. We had fruit like oranges, apples, pears, kiwi and more.
    That was my favourite part of the three years I went to VGS. We could also bring our phones which
    was very practical.</i></q></p>

    <p><q><i>My old school was one of the most cultural diverse schools in Oslo. It had students from all around the world, whcih made the school a very interesting place to both study and get to know people.</i></q></p>
