<h3>Innovation camp</h3>
    <p>It can be scary, at first, to meet a new group because you don`t
    know the members, if they are willing to work and if they are
    going to be open and respectful. It also takes more time to
    organize the meetings and the work in a group.
    However, it can be exciting and enriching to meet new people,
    to get to know them and hear different opinions through
    discussions.</p>
